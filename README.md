## Project description

Travel Lingo is a web based application that provides the platform by which anyone can in the quickest and most efficient way learn the basics to a new language. This project was initiated as a result of the language barrier challenges people face as they immigrate or travel to a new states that don’t speak one’s familiar language. The system will teach you as well as test you on your understanding of the new language, to gauge your level of proficiency. To realize the success of this software, a word game has been incorporated into the application for better interactive learning. In the event a learner needs clarity on a specific issue, the software provides a mechanism by which they can post a question on the forum where a language guru will attend to their query.
