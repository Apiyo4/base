# Overview

This document is the software-requirements specification document and it outlines the tasks that the system must do, as well as characteristics the system shall possess. The requirements are broken down into two categories: Functional and Non-functional requirements. The functional requirements specify the processes to perform while the Non-functional requirements outline the behavioral properties the system must have. Listing the requirements enables us define the scope of the system, thus preventing scope creep or inadequate features in the final deliverable.

1.  Administrator Login
    1. The system shall allow for the creation of an administrator when the sign up button is pressed.
    2. The application shall validate and verify the administrator’s username and password before allowing access to the system.
