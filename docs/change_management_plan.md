# Change Management plan
Often people are resistant to change due to a number of reasons such as the fear of the “unknown”, sometimes lack of tact in the changeover, mistrust of the change process and even times people are afraid the new technology might replace them and they get laid off. To demystify all these, a well thought out change management plan is necessary in order to facilitate successful deployment of the new system.
In the Case of Travel Lingo software in order to combat these barriers of change, we shall employ the normative approach of Re-educating the entire organizational change agents.

 ## Training
To begin with we shall need to train the people on the usage of the new software. The training shall follow the following guidelines:
-	The First batch of the people to get the training will include the organizational technical team of the organization. The technical team will be the backbone of the success of the entire software deployment and as such their knowledge on the system is essential.
-	All the facets of the software including the databases, User Interface functioning, and the entire documentation of the Travel Lingo will be handed over to the technical team to ensure they are well conversant with the software. This is important as they will be the first point of contact in the event users or Language administrators face problems with their initial usage of the application
-	Other training areas of interest to the technical team will include the installation of the system to the organizational hardware, as well as conversion of data from the legacy systems to the new language system
-	The second batch of people to get the training will be the Language administrators who will serve as the experts between the software and the users.
-	The system administrators will get comprehensive training on both the user and administrator side functionalities but more emphasis on the expert side. These will include the sign up and log in verification and validation as well as the security measures put in place to secure the software.
-	The language experts will be trained on using the administrator page by first getting hands-on training on obtaining and answering questions posted by the user for clarification. To add on to that, the training will involve how to respond to incomplete questions, or questions with grammatical errors in order to clear ambiguity on the users side.
-	Additionally, the language experts shall receive training on modifying the learning curriculum across all the different categories to be in-line with the organizational desired preference and as well as language under consideration.
-	Finally, the Users will receive the training on the usage of the application. In this scenario, the users may be organizational employees or clients. Either way, they will receive the training in order to work with the new software.
-	For Company employees, in-house workshops shall be organized for a maximum of 4 hours each week over the training period in order to reinforce the functioning of the new system from the old Language learning systems. For clients, training videos shall be posted on the current as-is systems in order to train them of the changes that occur in their learning ecosystem.
-	The end users shall be trained upon how to post questions they have regarding the language being taught, taking proficiency tests, playing the word games as well as going through the curriculum.

 ## Integration with the ecosystem/ Software
Integration of the Travel Lingo System will use the Lewin-Schein Model of change management that involves the 3 phases of unfreeze-move-refreeze. 
### Unfreeze 
– In order for the change process to begin we shall embark on activities that would create the need to replace prior software. This would be showcasing the downsides of the as-is system such as slower response times, low ratings and customer satisfaction and making clear the current conditions are not suitable.
### Move 
– Involves embarking of activities that facilitate the shift from the older system to the new system. This is the point where we shall utilize the most desirable deployment approach for ground breaking the Travel Lingo software into the company. Embark on massive training to ensure high success rates in transition to the new system.
### Refreeze 
– With the Travel Lingo application in place, we aim to take measures to support and reinforce the usage of the software and prevent regression back to legacy language learning software. We shall provide support by sending maintenance personnel periodically to the organization to work on debugging the software and providing updates to the Travel Lingo Application. In this phase it is also important to go over the benefits realized by transitioning to use of Travel Lingo Software such as increased customer satisfaction and lower costs of operation.

In integration of Travel Lingo Language learning software with the new ecosystem, a number of factors are going to be placed into consideration in order to find the perfect balance between what the client desires, vis-à-vis what we can deliver. Three main factors come into play: Cost, Time and Risk. We as Travel Lingo we pride ourselves in high success change over rates and thus we shall employ low risk Application Deployment approaches. 
In this case we shall use the Parallel Conversion Approach that has a high cost, lengthy time in change over, but has low risk associated with the conversion. This approach will allow to run both the as-is legacy system as well as the current Travel Lingo system concurrently and simultaneously side by side and thereby providing a seamless transition between the old and new systems.
Together with that we shall utilize Ramped Deployment technologies to slowly replace instances of old with new. 
In the event the organization prefers shorter transition time from the old system to the new and are working on a budget, then we shall utilize the Direct conversion Approach where we instantly stop the legacy software and begin the Travel Lingo application. Thus using the Environmental Monday Morning Adaptive approach 

 ## Fixing Discovered issues
To prevent fall back into the legacy Language learning systems, the following shall be carried out to fix any issues that arise amidst the use of Travel Lingo software system:
-	In the event a User experiences difficulty/ errors working on the Travel Lingo software, kindly contact the IT support department with the issue and they will provide a solution. Issues such as forgotten passwords, locked out users, invalid test results can all be handled by the local support personnel at the organization.
-	In the event of large issues such as software outages within the entire firm, kindly contact the manufacturer. Bugs in the system that would potentially lead to data loss of a breach in data privacy should be ticketed as high priority, while errors in curriculum should be ticketed with medium to low priority and handled in-house
